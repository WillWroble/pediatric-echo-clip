# EchoVALE: Vision-Aligned Language Encoder for Pediatric Echocardiography

## Abstract

Using a pretrained JEPA backbone, EchoVALE reframes clinical echocardiographic interpretation from multiple independent binary prediction tasks to the single continuous task of projecting clinical language onto echo video representation space. Without any label supervision, EchoVALE outperforms supervised diagnostic classifiers on their own benchmark, achieving 0.85 N-weighted AUROC across thousands of Fyler codes on held-out 2020+ studies. We show how this approach improves general clinical understanding compared to binary classifiers, and has downstream applications in zero-shot classification, natural language line validation, and full report generation.

## Introduction

Current approaches to automated echocardiographic interpretation treat each clinical finding as an independent binary classification task. This scales poorly: adding a new finding requires new labels and retraining, rare findings are irrecoverable without sufficient positive examples, and the full clinical content of an echocardiogram cannot be captured by any fixed set of classifiers.

EchoVALE replaces this paradigm with a single continuous task: given an echocardiographic study and any clinical text, score how well the text describes what is in the echo. The system scores a retrieval pool of ~180K known clinical lines against a study simultaneously, producing a probability field over clinical language space.

The line encoder learns from three converging signals:

1. **Language prior**: Frozen ClinicalBERT provides a pretrained clinical language geometry. Lines describing related findings are already neighbors in BERT space before any training.
2. **Co-occurrence structure**: The skip-gram objective reshapes this space by report context. Lines that co-occur in the same reports are pulled together; lines that never co-occur are pushed apart. This captures clinical relationships that language alone cannot (e.g. "status post Fontan" and "single ventricle physiology" co-occur despite being linguistically dissimilar).
3. **Physiological/visual signal**: Cross-attention over frozen video embeddings grounds the text representations in actual echocardiographic appearance. Lines are scored against what the echo physically shows, not just what tends to appear in reports.

These three signals are why zero-shot classification works. A novel clinical description inherits geometric proximity to related findings from the language prior, inherits co-occurrence context from the skip-gram, and is grounded in visual evidence by cross-attention. No training examples of the novel finding are required. When the model makes errors, they are typically confusions between visually or clinically similar findings that sit near each other in the learned space, not random failures.

## Methods

### Vision Backbone: EchoJEPA (`video_pretraining_v2/`)

EchoJEPA ViT-B pretrained on BCH pediatric echo data, initialized from V-JEPA 2.1 weights.
- 217K studies, ~11.4M AVI files
- ViT-B (86.8M params, 768d native)
- Masked latent prediction: predicts representations of masked spatiotemporal patches from visible patches, using positional embeddings of masked positions as prediction targets. No labels, no clinical text in the training signal.
- 4 clips sampled per video; all clips from a study (~200 total) fed directly into the line encoder
- JEPA outperforms PanEcho for the line encoder across all Fyler frequency buckets. JEPA tokens encode relational/predictive structure (trained for mutual spatiotemporal prediction), not just category-relevant features.

### Line Encoder: CrossAttentionPool (`line_tokenizer_v2/`)

**LineEncoder**: Frozen Bio_ClinicalBERT (~110M params, 768d CLS) + learned linear projection. Encodes any clinical text string into a line embedding.

**CrossAttentionPool**: Line embeddings cross-attend over the full set of ~200 frozen video clip embeddings with learned W_Q, W_K, W_V (~18,306,048 trainable params including last BERT layer). Each line asks its own question of the video. A line about tricuspid regurgitation attends to different clip tokens than a line about LV dilation. The output is a line-relative study representation: the video content most relevant to that specific clinical query.

**Scoring**: Dot product between the cross-attention output (line-relative study representation) and the raw line embedding, passed through sigmoid, yielding a per-line relevance score.

**Training objective**: Skip-gram BCE. Each field-study pair is treated as a separate training sample. Lines co-occurring in the same field of the same report are positives; randomly sampled lines are negatives. Each line scored independently with no softmax forcing competition between lines. Following VL-JEPA (Chen et al., Meta FAIR, 2024), EchoVALE operates entirely in embedding space rather than autoregressively generating tokens, further constraining the answer space to binary relevance and concentrating representational power on the query side.

**W_V justification**: Frozen JEPA video embeddings have never been exposed to contrastive text alignment. Without W_V, W_K does double duty mapping video tokens into a text-compatible space and computing attention weights. W_V (~590K params) separates these roles.

**Current best**: v11 (JEPA base, W_V, post-CA MLP, 4x BERT expansion). no Post-CA MLP (v6) lowers val loss and performs better on pre 2020 studies but hurts overall Fyler AUROCs. Ablations ongoing (v11, v12).

### Generation (`generate_lines.py`)

- Scores ~180K clinical lines from the 2020+ training set against a study's video embeddings
- Mutual KNN + connected components hotspot clustering (default K=10; maximal clique decomposition gives upper bound of K+1 lines per hotspot)
- Output: `{field: {hotspots, reference, n_hotspots, n_active}}`
- Unmapped reference lines included with `score: None`
- Embedding caching via `get_or_encode_lines`

v11 outperforms v6 on 31/32 diagnoses. EchoVALE (v11) outperforms supervised Fyler probes (clip_fyler) on 31/32 diagnoses (exception: LSVC, where the supervised probe has a slight edge because there are many line/severity variants).
### vs. Supervised Classification

Using the same Fyler evaluation framework, a supervised classification architecture (binary probes over frozen video embeddings) was compared against EchoVALE across all evaluated Fyler codes. EchoVALE outperforms on the majority of codes, including common ones, despite never seeing a Fyler label during training.

### External Validation

- Outside referral cohort (~3,300 studies, 58 countries)
- On SG diagnosis labels, JEPA line encoder ties study-CLIP supervised probes (14 vs 13 wins on primary diagnoses)
- Strong zero-shot results on rare/structural CHD codes where line encoder beats ridge probes

## Downstream Applications

All are different readouts of the same trained system:

**Zero-shot classifier**: Score any clinical line against any study. No retraining when new codes appear. Encode the clinical description and score it.

**Line validator**: Score human-written report text against the echo. Any text <512 tokens (BERT context window). Natural deployment path for clinical report QA.

**Heatmap / report generation**: Score the full 180K line retrieval pool against a study. Hotspots identify clusters of related/variant lines for each finding. Output is a probability field over clinical language space.
